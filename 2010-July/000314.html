 &gt; Hi,
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; my Name is Sascha Manns from open-slx. I had heard that the
 &gt; &gt; development of sax2 is closed. Is that right?
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is correct yes. We are maintaining old versions as long
 &gt; as the maintenance period lasts but there is no active new
 &gt; development for sax2 anymore.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The main reason for this is because Xorg doesn't require
 &gt; a static configuration file anymore. SaX2's main task was to
 &gt; create that file and because of the fact that this base
 &gt; requirement doesn't exist anymore the project is at the
 &gt; end of its lifecycle

Today everything focuesses on autodetection and on-the-fly 
configuration during run time. This is considered the future
by many in the upstream community.

X can still take a static configuration - and for some corner
cases there may still be a need for this - however the format
of the configuration has changed: for example instead of a
single config file X will take each section now in a separate
file. This will help creating only partial configurations.
Still the amount of changes needed for SaX2 would require an
effort that doesn't seem to be warrented for the corner cases 
which may still exist.
Still, if someone's interested in picking it up nothing should
stop this person.
See also the announcement I've made last December:
<A HREF="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2009-12/msg00017.html">http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2009-12/msg00017.html</A>

 &gt; 
 &gt; As the author and maintainer of sax2 it's sad to see this
 &gt; bug Xorg has evolved into a new direction where such a tool
 &gt; doesn't make sense anymore. Anyway the 10 year success story
 &gt; of sax2 is something I'm looking back with a smile on my
 &gt; face :)
 &gt; 

Yup, it was one of the pieces which earned SUSE the reputation
of one of the most user friendly distributions out there.
Thanks Marcus for your hard work there!

Cheers,
	Egbert.
