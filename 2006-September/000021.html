<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I would just like, when an installed machine boots to check whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> current xorg.conf file will still work, and then invoke the reconfigure steps 
</I>&gt;<i> if needed.
</I>
you can check if the X-Server still runs with the current config or not.
That is easy to implement I think. Problematic is if there are changes
which requires a config change but the X-Server still runs with that
config. For example somebody changes its mouse from one without a wheel
to one with a wheel. The server runs but the wheel may not work if
the ZAxisMapping is missing. There are more than such cases and the worst
case is if the X-Server runs but the screen stays black. There is no
possibility to check that. I spent some time to think of a clean concept
how to recognize environment changes and I must admit I wasn't able
to find a good solution.

&gt;<i> So basically if the user swops out his video card, or replaces his monitor 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly, but basically any change that would prevent X from starting correctly 
</I>&gt;<i> should cause an automagic reconfiguration. Ideally it should also pick up one 
</I>&gt;<i> or two other things like if the nvidia drivers have been installed since the 
</I>&gt;<i> last run.
</I>
As said if the X-Server couldn't be started it's easy. The check for the
binary drivers (nvidia and fglrx) has been implemented into the sax2
startup script.

&gt;<i> I don't know if this is (directly) doable, or if I'll need to write some code 
</I>&gt;<i> plugging into sax2 abilities where possible, I'm quite willing and able to 
</I>&gt;<i> write some code myself if needed, but it would be a waste if sax2 can already 
</I>&gt;<i> do something like this.
</I>
sax2 only has a check for the binary driver part and I would consider this
code as a hack but I was forced to implement something like that. Everything
else needs to be coded first. By the way checking if an X-Server could be
started and is accessable has been implemented in the

	/usr/share/sax/modules/CheckServer.pm

perl module. Maybe you can make use of it when you start implementing

Regards
Marcus
