<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Check for hardware changes and reconfigure if needed on post-install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bootups. This one should JUST check if something has changed, and if so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should reconfigure. The GUI should certainly only be involved IF there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what exactly do you mean with hardware changes ? I assume
</I>&gt;<i> Graphics card, Monitor, keyboard, mouse ? From my experience it is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to track down the right action for hotplug devices. So I would
</I>&gt;<i> not check for changes in Monitor,Keyboard and Mouse. I did that in
</I>&gt;<i> the past and created more problems than solutions. To find out whether
</I>&gt;<i> the graphics card has changed can be done by calling:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	sax2 -p
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This prints out the PCI location and the name of the card. If
</I>&gt;<i> something there has changed you could reinvoke sax2 with the option -r
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	sax2 -r
</I>Okay, let me explain what I was hoping for here. 
I would just like, when an installed machine boots to check whether the 
current xorg.conf file will still work, and then invoke the reconfigure steps 
if needed.
So basically if the user swops out his video card, or replaces his monitor 
mostly, but basically any change that would prevent X from starting correctly 
should cause an automagic reconfiguration. Ideally it should also pick up one 
or two other things like if the nvidia drivers have been installed since the 
last run.

I don't know if this is (directly) doable, or if I'll need to write some code 
plugging into sax2 abilities where possible, I'm quite willing and able to 
write some code myself if needed, but it would be a waste if sax2 can already 
do something like this.
