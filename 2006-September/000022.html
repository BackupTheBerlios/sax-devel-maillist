Well partially - my install setup uses a &quot;click here&quot; with a two-layer 
time-out, one is inside the GUI itself, no input after 20 -seconds die and 
flag the config as bad.
For those cases where X stalls halfway through and the program would never 
run, I start a script called xcatch BEFOREHAND in the background. 
Xcatch sleeps for 30 seconds, if it finds X in the process table at that 
time -we KNOW something is  broken, so kill it off, chvt 1 and mark config as 
bad.
If we DO get a click from the GUI, then we mark the config as good, and kill 
xcatch instead.
This works for initial setup.

I have a variant which is NON-interactive for post-install testing, but this 
will ONLY catch a config where X fails to start at all :S

Seems there is no way to do this check without having SOME sort of user input 
validation.

One possibility may be a patch to KDM - which will flag the config as good as 
soon as KDM gets any kind of sensible input- but that has it's own 
drawbacks  - like having your config marked bad if a power outage reboots 
your box while you're at work.

</I>&gt;<i> sax2 only has a check for the binary driver part and I would consider this

</I>&gt;<i> Everything else needs to be coded first. By the way checking if an X-Server

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	/usr/share/sax/modules/CheckServer.pm
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> perl module. Maybe you can make use of it when you start implementing
</I>I actually think my variation though simpler code is more advanced and catches 
more scenarios, albeit only during initial setup where interactivity is an 
acceptable loss.

I had to do some more patches to the sax2 code to get proper work b.t.w. most 
notably two functions that use rpm to check for dependencies - this is a 
problem on slack/OL - although both CAN install rpm they usually don't - so 
the checks would fail - ditto for debian derivatives.

For now I simply disabled the checks and made them return true in all cases. I 
could probably hack them to check using slapt-get on slackware - but the 
problem is that package names and versions vary between distro's - so most 
likely they will still fail even though the deps are met.

I didn't bother to modify the yast call for installs, even though his is NOT 
portable to ANY other distro's - disabling the check for package presense 
effectively makes that function a &quot;can't happen&quot;.

As it stands, out of my test boxes, I got amazing results on some, and bad 
results on others and one where the sax2  config is COMPLETELY beserk - it 
half starts and then locks up all input on a screen with apparently CGA 
colors only (it's an i855 card, though the ONLY driver I have had sensible 
results with was vesa - fbdev freaks out on this one, some BIOS issue I 
think - 855resolution MIGHT help on this - though I don't exactly understand 
how to make 855resolution and sax2 play nicely together - haven't had time to 
study 855 yet).
Eventually I opted rather than replacing my own setup system, for using sax2 
to EXPAND it. My system is quite powerful in it's own way, it uses various 
methods to try and configure systems, and lets the user choose the best one 
with a LOT of fallback checks to rule out half-crashes and such.
This means that where one dectector fails another usually succeeds.

Finally I have some predone highly custom xorg.conf files for obscure cards 
(mostly written and contributed by users) like those on some thinkpads, if 
all detections fail - I try these one by one - so even the very obscure stuff 
tends to work ok, provided anybody anywhere has ever made it work - and sent 
me their config file.

I'll send you the code once I sign off on OL4.1B - maybe some of the ideas 
will be usefull to sax2.

This is what I love about free software. Coopetition :)
