I got it all working - it wasn' the PM files that were failing, it was the 
support files for those (the .bs's and so)

After much hacking and some manual work - I have a fully working sax2 package 
for OpenLab, which will be upstream compatible with slackware assuming the 
dependencies are met (OL ships them all as  a matter of course, slackware the 
user decides if he wants them).

I uploaded the package to my own site at:
<A HREF="http://silentcoder.co.za/downloads/sax2-8.1_98.1-i486-1ajv.tgz">http://silentcoder.co.za/downloads/sax2-8.1_98.1-i486-1ajv.tgz</A>

You are welcome to provide either a link or a mirror of the package.

Now comes the part of integrating it into the LIVEcd as best possible. So I 
hoped you could give me a few quick pointers.

I have basically three sepperate tasks I need done.
1) Setup the INITIAL configuration on LIVEcd bootup so that the user can get a 
desktop. If at all possible, this should NOT load the GUI, but merely 
generate a workable xorg.conf file so the user can get a desktop.

2) Check for hardware changes and reconfigure if needed on post-install 
bootups. This one should JUST check if something has changed, and if so 
should reconfigure. The GUI should certainly only be involved IF there is a 
change.

3)  Configure advanced hardware like touchscreens by hand. This is the easy 
one, I merely need to add a launch-button for sax2 into OLAD.

So the last remaining questions from me are whether sax2 can do 1 and 2 and if 
so - what commandlines would I need ? I'll worry about the bootscripts :)

I did the X setup tools for OL4.0 myself, and enhanced them for the first 4.1 
builds, but I am very willing to concede that you wrote by far the best X 
config tool I have ever seen - hugely better than any of my sets of scripts, 
hence my willingness to hack and tweak until it worked.
Giving back the package to all slackware users as well - seems only fair to 
me :)

Ciao

PS. Thanks for all your help in getting it up, I am actually mid-in a project 
we are doing in collaboration with Novell and it was Novell who initially 
sugested that I look at sax2 - I am happy I listened :)
