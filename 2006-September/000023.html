<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; you can check if the X-Server still runs with the current config or not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is easy to implement I think. Problematic is if there are changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which requires a config change but the X-Server still runs with that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; config. For example somebody changes its mouse from one without a wheel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to one with a wheel. The server runs but the wheel may not work if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the ZAxisMapping is missing. There are more than such cases and the worst
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case is if the X-Server runs but the screen stays black. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibility to check that. I spent some time to think of a clean concept
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to recognize environment changes and I must admit I wasn't able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to find a good solution.
</I>&gt;<i> I did ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Well partially - my install setup uses a &quot;click here&quot; with a two-layer 
</I>&gt;<i> time-out, one is inside the GUI itself, no input after 20 -seconds die and 
</I>&gt;<i> flag the config as bad.
</I>&gt;<i> For those cases where X stalls halfway through and the program would never 
</I>&gt;<i> run, I start a script called xcatch BEFOREHAND in the background. 
</I>&gt;<i> Xcatch sleeps for 30 seconds, if it finds X in the process table at that 
</I>&gt;<i> time -we KNOW something is  broken, so kill it off, chvt 1 and mark config as 
</I>&gt;<i> bad.
</I>&gt;<i> If we DO get a click from the GUI, then we mark the config as good, and kill 
</I>&gt;<i> xcatch instead.
</I>&gt;<i> This works for initial setup.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a variant which is NON-interactive for post-install testing, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> will ONLY catch a config where X fails to start at all :S
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems there is no way to do this check without having SOME sort of user input 
</I>&gt;<i> validation.
</I>
yes I agree completely

&gt;<i> One possibility may be a patch to KDM - which will flag the config as good as 
</I>&gt;<i> soon as KDM gets any kind of sensible input- but that has it's own 
</I>&gt;<i> drawbacks  - like having your config marked bad if a power outage reboots 
</I>&gt;<i> your box while you're at work. 
</I>
:<i>-) some weird scenario here always could break the rule 
</I>
&gt;<i> I had to do some more patches to the sax2 code to get proper work b.t.w. most 
</I>&gt;<i> notably two functions that use rpm to check for dependencies - this is a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem on slack/OL - although both CAN install rpm they usually don't - so 
</I>&gt;<i> the checks would fail - ditto for debian derivatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now I simply disabled the checks and made them return true in all cases. I 
</I>yes, I should take care for something like that but it seems
hard because there are many package manager around. Best solution would
be to not need any of these checks. 

&gt;<i> As it stands, out of my test boxes, I got amazing results on some, and bad 
</I>&gt;<i> results on others and one where the sax2  config is COMPLETELY beserk - it 
</I>&gt;<i> half starts and then locks up all input on a screen with apparently CGA 
</I>&gt;<i> colors only (it's an i855 card, though the ONLY driver I have had sensible 
</I>&gt;<i> results with was vesa - fbdev freaks out on this one, some BIOS issue I 
</I>&gt;<i> think - 855resolution MIGHT help on this - though I don't exactly understand 
</I>&gt;<i> how to make 855resolution and sax2 play nicely together - haven't had time to 
</I>&gt;<i> study 855 yet).
</I>
sax already makes use of 855resolution. It writes the parmaters to
/etc/sysconfig/videobios and calls it every time you save the configuration.
There are some problems around this so I will change some things here.

&gt;<i> I'll send you the code once I sign off on OL4.1B - maybe some of the ideas 
</I>&gt;<i> will be usefull to sax2.
</I>
Would be great thanks

&gt;<i> This is what I love about free software. Coopetition :)
</I>
*yeah* open source... open communication ;)

Best Regards
Marcus
