<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> w00000000t
</I>&gt;<i> I got it all working - it wasn' the PM files that were failing, it was the 
</I>&gt;<i> support files for those (the .bs's and so)
</I>
*wow* great you rock ! :-)

&gt;<i> After much hacking and some manual work - I have a fully working sax2 package 
</I>&gt;<i> for OpenLab, which will be upstream compatible with slackware assuming the 
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies are met (OL ships them all as  a matter of course, slackware the 
</I>&gt;<i> user decides if he wants them).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I uploaded the package to my own site at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://silentcoder.co.za/downloads/sax2-8.1_98.1-i486-1ajv.tgz">http://silentcoder.co.za/downloads/sax2-8.1_98.1-i486-1ajv.tgz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are welcome to provide either a link or a mirror of the package.
</I>
Thanks a lot for all your effort

&gt;<i> Now comes the part of integrating it into the LIVEcd as best possible. So I 
</I>&gt;<i> hoped you could give me a few quick pointers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have basically three sepperate tasks I need done.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Setup the INITIAL configuration on LIVEcd bootup so that the user can
</I>&gt;<i> get a desktop. If at all possible, this should NOT load the GUI, but merely 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a workable xorg.conf file so the user can get a desktop.
</I>
yes this can be done by calling sax2 in the following way:

	sax2 -r -a

Please note if there are multiple cards installed sax tries to activate
them all together. Unfortunately the quality of the drivers isn't as
good enough as this process would work in any case. According to this
my suggestion would be to always configure only the primary chip even
if there are multiple chips available. This can be done by calling sax2
in the following way:

	sax2 -r -c 0 -a

&gt;<i> 2) Check for hardware changes and reconfigure if needed on post-install 
</I>&gt;<i> bootups. This one should JUST check if something has changed, and if so 
</I>&gt;<i> should reconfigure. The GUI should certainly only be involved IF there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>
what exactly do you mean with hardware changes ? I assume
Graphics card, Monitor, keyboard, mouse ? From my experience it is
hard to track down the right action for hotplug devices. So I would
not check for changes in Monitor,Keyboard and Mouse. I did that in
the past and created more problems than solutions. To find out whether
the graphics card has changed can be done by calling:

	sax2 -p

This prints out the PCI location and the name of the card. If
something there has changed you could reinvoke sax2 with the option -r

	sax2 -r

Starts from scratch detecting the hardware etc, etc...

&gt;<i> 3)  Configure advanced hardware like touchscreens by hand. This is the easy 
</I>&gt;<i> one, I merely need to add a launch-button for sax2 into OLAD.
</I>
sax2 supports a profile batch mode (a very very simple language I wrote)
which allows you to write a file and pass it to sax2 to for example
create an InputDevice section for a touchscreen. You could have a look
at /usr/share/sax/profile for details. Unfortunately dokumentation is
rather bad because this mode was meant for debugging originally :-)

&gt;<i> So the last remaining questions from me are whether sax2 can do 1 and 2
</I>&gt;<i> and if so - what commandlines would I need ? I'll worry about
</I>&gt;<i> the bootscripts :)
</I>
I think this is all feasible for you ;)

&gt;<i> I did the X setup tools for OL4.0 myself, and enhanced them for the first 4.1 
</I>&gt;<i> builds, but I am very willing to concede that you wrote by far the best X 
</I>&gt;<i> config tool I have ever seen - hugely better than any of my sets of scripts, 
</I>&gt;<i> hence my willingness to hack and tweak until it worked.
</I>&gt;<i> Giving back the package to all slackware users as well - seems only fair to 
</I>&gt;<i> me :)
</I>
Thank you very much for this very nice compliment. There aren't much
people out in the world who are interested in a X configuration tool.
It makes me feeling happy.

&gt;<i> A.J.
</I>&gt;<i> PS. Thanks for all your help in getting it up, I am actually mid-in a project 
</I>&gt;<i> we are doing in collaboration with Novell and it was Novell who initially 
</I>&gt;<i> sugested that I look at sax2 - I am happy I listened :)
</I>
I'm hopping you will be successfull in the project. If you have any
question feel free to ask. I'm pretty sure you know there are bugs and
if you search for a while you will find one :) So don't hesitate to
contact me at any time 

Best Regards
Marcus
